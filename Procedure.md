## Procedure

**Purpose**: To make vehicle follow the given trajectory.

**Stages**:

1 - Taking trajectory points from file and visualizing 50 of them in Rviz.

2 - Making a lateral controller.

3 - Making a longitudinal controller.

4 - Visualizing the errors on PlotJuggler.

5 - Tuning lateral and longitudinal control parameters with respect to the trajectory.

**General Method**: 
	
	* This assignment was done with ChatGPT assistance. 
	* PD is used in longitudinal controller
	* PD is used in lateral controller

 **General Note**: Variables with <name_of_variable>_ are controller class's members. Hence, they can be used in all member functions. They are declared mostly in onTimer() function or initialized at the beggining of the constructor.

**Stage1** - Taking trajectory points from file and visualizing 50 of them in Rviz:
	
 	* waypoint.txt file was read fully at first.

	* In order to choose 50 points, the closest trajectory point should be found. For this a function was created.

	* Now, we can choose 50 points beginning from the position of the vehicle.(This part is onTimer() function and repeated for every 30ms)

 **Note**: "visualization_rate" was initialized as 50 at the constructor option part. The all initializations are:

**Stage2** - Making a lateral controller:

	* At first, lateral deviation was calculated. The function calcLateralDeviation() was included into Controller class to be used in onTimer() function.

  	* PD control was used. Kp and Kd values were determined with the help of Ziegler–Nichols method(no overshoot case).

**Stage3** - Making a longitudinal controller:

	* PD control was used. Kp and Kd values were determined with the help of Ziegler–Nichols method(no overshoot case).

**Stage4** - Visualizing the errors on PlotJuggler:

	* As the simulation was run, "velocity_error" and "lateral_deviation_" are sent as error messages. These are read from Plotjuggler.

 **Stage5** - Tuning lateral and longitudinal control parameters with respect to the trajectory:

 	* This part was done considering the trajectory structure. The trajectory was divided into 5 segments and 3 types:
  		1- Beginning(small curve)
    	2- Transition between beginning and U-turn(medium curve)
      	3- U-turn(high curve)
		4- Transition between U-turn and ending(medium curve)
  		5- Ending(small curve)
    	
     	* The segments were defined by the velocity of vehicle. The change of the default parameter values was done by taking the outcome of the wrong simulation results.(e.g. at U-turn, the vehicle turns out of the way. So, Kp was increased to overcome this issue.)
